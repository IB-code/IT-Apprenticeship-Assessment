# IT Apprenticeship Assessment

The assignment is to create a replication of brick-breaker.

Brick Breaker (platformer) is a Breakout clone in which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The paddle moves horizontally. The player gets 3 lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new, harder level. If all lives are lost, the game is over. There are many versions of brick breaker, some in which you can shoot flaming fireballs or play with more than one ball if the player gets a power up. You are welcome to be creative as long as you achieve the requirements set out in the game requirements section.
